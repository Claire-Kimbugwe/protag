# ProTag
ProTag leverages Genius' API to provide users data visualizations of their 
favorite rap songs.  ProTag was inspired by the need for production information 
of songs.  The major components of hip hop song production are:

1. The recording of the rapper (performer) delivering his lyrics.
2. The making of the beat (song's instrumental, non-lyrical/non-vocal rhythmic backing track) by the 
producer.  A producer's beat is often identified by the producer's signature, 
aka tag.

A user can search their favorite song, performer, album, or producer to return a 
data visualization for it.
