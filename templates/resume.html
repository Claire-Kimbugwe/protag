  <h5> ProTag's Inspiration</h5>
  Ryan's love for hip hop and data inspired her to create ProTag.  She grew
  up listening to 90s West Coast rap and considers this an ode her 14 year old
  self, who was often punished growing up for rapping the explicit lyrics of 
  her favorite rap songs.

  <br>

  In middle school, she developed a stan-like interest in the music by 
  Pharrell Williams.  Through her research of Williams, Ryan learned he was
  one-half of the production duo, 
  <a href="/producers/4617"> The Neptunes</a>, who, by 
  2003, produced 43% of the songs played on US radio.  This got her interested 
  in learning about the beat makers of her other favorite songs to see how 
  they compared to The Neptunes.  There was a wealth of information on the web 
  about a song's performers, but, unfortunately, not much about its producers, 
  and certainly not in a digestible format.

  <br>

  She appreciated Genius' (formerly Rap Genius) documentation of producers and 
  thus chose their API for ProTag.  Her goal is to shed more light on the 
  people behind the scenes of her favorite genre of music and mesh her 
  interests and experiences data analyzing and modeling as a former Financial 
  Data Analyst and Economics grad to visualize the ever-tangling web of the 
  hip-hop music industry.  

  <br>
  <br>

  Ryan hopes to share ProTag with The Neptunes and every producer she features
  on her site and expand it to visualize the production data of other genres 
  of music.
