70,MF DOOM,https://images.genius.com/263743633b6e58854e753b25dca6beab.430x430x1.jpg,The Best MC with no chain ya ever heard!

MF DOOM is an English-born American underground hip hop artist, best known for his “super villain” stage persona and unique lyrics and lyrical abilities.

Born Daniel Dumile, in 1988 he formed the group K.M.D.—which stands for “Kausing Much Damage”—with his brother, DJ Subroc. At the time, his stage name was Zev Love X. KMD was eventually signed to Elektra after some minor hype, and they released one album titled Mr. Hood. Before the release of their second album, Black Bastards, Subroc was struck and killed by a car in 1993.

After his brother’s death, Dumile quit rapping and lived on benches for three years. He soon began rapping underground with his now iconic 



The mask was based on a prop mask from the film Gladiator. In 1998, DOOM told Ego Trip, “it’s music we’re selling, not my face.”

You can see how DOOM’s mask changed through the years here!

Dumile then adopted the identity MF DOOM, based on Marvel supervillian Doctor Doom—whose name is always spelled in all capital letters in the comic books, which is why you always spell MF DOOM in all caps!

Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

Although, he told an interviewer that the name was actually a nickname from his 

Yeah and for the record I didn’t get the idea from [Doctor Doom]… [laughs]. I been Doom ever since I was born, my momma call me Doom so…

In 1999, DOOM released his debut solo album,  Doomsday. The album had three  “Dead Bent,” “ Greenbacks,” and “The M.I.C.”

For his next album, Take Me To Your Leader, DOOM introduced a new moniker, King Geedorah. After that, he released Vaudeville Villain and Venomous Villain under the moniker Viktor Vaughn.

In 2004, under the name MF DOOM, he released MM.. FOOD—an anagram of MF DOOM. His last solo album, Born Like This, mostly fell under the radar, but is nonetheless a solid project. It spawned multiple classic songs, such as “Gazzillion Ear,” “Ballskin” and the lyrically inclined “That’s That.”

DOOM received critical acclaim for his 2004 collaboration with producer Madlib, Madvillainy. With a 93/100 score on Metacritic, and praise from hip-hop legends, Madvillainy is known as one of the best rap albums of all time. DOOM told an interviewer why he likes 


It just makes it fun cos there’s another person there with another artistic point of view. If it’s a producer it makes my job easier, I don’t have to think about the beat and the rhyme which is kinda tricky. I can let them have their vision with the beat and then do my rhyme. Let them mix the song, see it how they see it and maybe change one or two things, but it makes it good.

I love collaborating, I’m a team player. I love it when I’m working with other artists and see how they get down and exchanging ideas, it’s fun.


During his rap career, DOOM has used a plethora of aliases and 


MF DOOM
DOOM
Metal Face DOOM
Viktor Vaughn
King Geedorah
Metal Fingers
Zev Love X (with the group K.M.D.)

Madvillain (with Madlib)

DANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse)

DOOMSTARKS (with Ghostface Killah)

JJ DOOM (with Jneiro Jarel)

NehruvianDOOM (with Bishop Nehru)



Luckily, Genius has a tag that houses all of DOOM’s aliases, monikers, and collaborations here.

Each character has his own established personality, as DOOM 


Their styles tend to be similar, people might say ‘damn Vik you sound like DOOM’ and Vik don’t like that so he’s like ‘fuck DOOM!’ you know? DOOM is getting more attention or whatever. But that’s something I’m also playing on, they got little rivalries going on. It’s going to come out later on a little more. I try to keep them pretty much straight forward, this way each album, each character, is its own experience.

 The characters allow you to not reinvent yourself all the time. You can still be DOOM but do it differently through a different character.

Exactly.


Also an established (and amazing) producer, DOOM has released multiple compilation albums of his beats, like the Special Herbs series. He spoke about his producing/songwriting process in an 


What I usually do when I’m producing a record, I’ll come up with the beat first… And then the beat will inspire the lyrics, you know what I’m sayin'? So, in that particular example [“Beef Rapp”] that was the main song, that song defined the record, […] so I came up with that particular song first. Everything else spawned from there.

I heard the loop first, cut the loop, put the drums to it, polish it up with the 808s, but I don’t really over-do it too much… I like to try to keep it as close to the original as possible. Leave something for the imagination, but enough to get the translation across. Then just write to it, keep it simple.


Using his JJ DOOM collaboration album as an example, DOOM explained the process behind his iconic, obscure TV dialogue samples and 


 The way the sampling works on the album, specifically the intro, skits and the use of vocal snippets throughout, that really reminds me of you. It reminds me of the King Geedorah project for example. Was that part of the album something you looked after?

Yeah I definitely… well you know we spoke about it like ‘it definitely needs to have skits on it’ and JJ would be like ‘yo DOOM you need to put some skits on there’ and I was like ‘yeah I got some stuff, I got some stuff’. But I had to wait until the last minute because collecting these voices is not as easy as it sounds [laughs]. I gotta watch hours and hours of old vintage footage, listen to hours and hours of lectures.

I’m sleeping while playing this shit, listening, and then in the third hour of some long lecture it’ll say the right word. So then it’s like ‘oh shit there it is!’ Wake up and look at the timer, note the time when it happened and go back to sleep. When I wake up I’ll find it again and chop it and put it in. It’s a real tedious process, but as I’m writing songs I’m collecting pieces, and I’m collecting pieces that pertain to the songs, and then I condense them and make the story. I like to put an intro so people get a feel for what’s going on. It sets the tone, almost like scenery.


You might wonder how he finds all of these samples, and he talked about that 


 I remember reading in a previous interview that you’d spent hours collecting stuff, I think you were talking about King Geedorah again. So despite having done that for years, and I’m assuming collecting a fairly sizeable library of samples, you’re still at it?

Yup, yup. It’s entertaining, you know? I don’t watch TV but I do that all day. I be cleaning the house and playing some obscure, weird shit. And it’ll be fun stuff, I bump into some interesting things.


An old-fashioned man, DOOM doesn’t have any social media accounts. His verified Twitter account only has one  “DOOM IS NOT ON TWITTER.”


“They got the Facebook site, but it’s more like a fan site. I never looked at this shit. I’m not on Twitter. I’m trying to get a old beeper matter of fact, a sky pager. I’m trying to go back to that, do the upside down texting. I’m old school, so I keep it to the way it was. I like to stay… it keeps me focused.

I think a lot of that stuff over sensitises everything. You get lost. It’s noise, like ‘ka ka ka ka ka’. […] People get caught up in what other people think about them, so much. But what do you think about yourself? Do you think about yourself as much as what you think other people are thinking about you? So… that’s something that should be…

54884,Mr. Hanky,https://images.genius.com/b442cacf69b3c7ebaf7e66b5bb8ac657.436x436x1.jpg,He has constructed club-cracking anthems for Nicki Minaj, Jeezy, Gucci Mane, Yo Gotti and
Young Dolph. His music became radio mainstays last year with two breezy, laidback singles–
“California” performed by Colonel Loud featuring Young Dolph, Rico Barrino and T.I. and
“On the Way” featuring DJ Luke Nasty.
Under the tutelage of platinum producer/label CEO Mr. Collipark, his production prowess
helped jumpstart the careers of Soulja Boy and V.I.C., as well as provided savage soundtracks
for Ying Yang Twins. From laying down unpredictable production for Atlanta’s newest
superstars-in- the-making Dae Dae and YFN Lucci, to Wale, Travis Porter and K Camp, to
veteran rappers Fabolous and Plies, multi-faceted hip hop/R&B/ EDM beat technician Mr.
Hanky is the most accomplished music producer that you may have never heard of.
With a musical flair that bounces between riveting dance tracks, mid-tempo melodic grooves and
throbbing R&B and Top 40 ballads, Mr. Hanky cannot be contained to one particular genre or
style. And over the last few years, he has been quietly overhauling the soundscape of urban
music.
“I work hard to give artist a better platform to succeed by creating music that crosses genres and
reaches different demographics,” Mr. Hanky explains. “In the last three or four years, I just
started creating a whole new wave. I started creating a different sound because everything was
starting to sound the same.”
Born Corey Dennard and raised in East Atlanta, Hanky’s musical roots date back to childhood.
Both his mother and sister are trained musicians, and young Corey got his feet wet in music
playing trumpet in the school band and learning the piano. He cultivated those talents into
landing a scholarship to Southern University, where he played in the Human Jukebox Marching
Band.
“I’m a musician before I’m a producer,” he points out.
It was in college that he started making beats in his dorm room and hustling burned CDs for
extra cash. By the time he finished college and moved back home to the A, word had already
made it back home that the kid had some heat. Building his resume, he worked with several
independent artists and eventually landed a position as in-house producer at Collipark Music.
While at the label, he helped catapult the careers of Soulja Boy and V.I.C., producing the club
smash ‘Smart Girl Dumb Booty" by Tex James featuring Stuey Rock and Dallas duo Treal
Lee and Prince Rick’s street anthem “Throwed Off” (Fuck Everybody).
In 2006, he launched his own imprint Mr. Hanky Productions and since then, his client list has
swelled to include some of the most-well- known artists in the music industry. Last year, Hanky’s
runaway hit single the relaxed, laidback "California” performed by Colonel Loud featuring
Young Dolph, Rico Barrino and T.I. made a huge impact at radio. The infectious single has since
appeared in the motion picture Keanu and is slated for two major movie releases next year.

He followed up with “On the Way” performed by DJ Luke Nasty, which hit radio and caught on
like wildfire. The single reached more than 3,000 spins per week on urban and rhythmic radio
stations across the country.
“When collaborating with artist, I encourage them to go beyond their comfort zone and speak to
a wider range of listeners beyond their neighborhood”, Mr. Hanky explains. “Every day I
continue to look for ways to be more creative and to come up with records that the people want.”
That is exactly what he has done and what he will continue to do. Mr. Hanky is developing new
artists under his production company and has a brand new album in the works with star-studded
singles already on deck.
I’m just cocking back, loaded and ready to go,” he says.
Quiet as it’s kept, Mr. Hanky has been making hit records for over a decade. With a flair for
cooking up hip hop anthems and radio buzz records, Mr. Hanky has built up an impressive list of
production credits. The BMI producer has been able to stay in demand over the years because he
refrains from focusing on trends and strives to create timeless music.
“I can make a song for your local trap artist and then, I can do something for a gospel or R&B
artist or a pop record,” says Mr. Hanky. “I do what feels best.”
